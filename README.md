# Hi — I'm Mikołaj Karkowski 👋

Full-stack .NET engineer focused on building productive, maintainable desktop and web applications.

- 🔭 I'm currently working on: **Finance Manager** — a personal budgeting application built with Blazor.  
- 🌱 I'm learning and improving: advanced Blazor patterns, desktop app UX with WPF, and robust API design.  
- 💬 Ask me about: Blazor, WPF, REST APIs, .NET architecture and app performance.  
- ⚡ Fun fact: my hobby is photography — I enjoy capturing landscapes and street scenes.

## What I build
I design and implement end-to-end solutions across desktop and web: rich WPF clients, Blazor web apps, and reliable APIs. I favour clear architecture, strong typing, and pragmatic automation (tests & CI).

- Desktop: WPF, MVVM patterns, responsive UI for Windows users  
- Web: Blazor (client & server) for interactive, component-driven experiences  
- APIs: RESTful APIs with .NET, secure endpoints and clean versioning
